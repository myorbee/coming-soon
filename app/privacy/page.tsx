            <p className="lead">Welcome to Orbee! This Privacy Policy explains how Orbee ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects your personal information when you use our AI voice assistant service for Gmail, our website (orbee.cc or similar), and related services (collectively, the "Service").</p>
            <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
            
            <h2 id="information-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>
            
            <h3>a. Information You Provide Directly:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register for an Orbee account, we collect information such as your name, email address, password (stored hashed), and the primary phone number(s) you register to call Orbee from.</li>
              <li><strong>Gmail Account Authorization:</strong> To provide the Service, you will grant Orbee permission to access your Gmail account via Google's OAuth 2.0 authorization. We will securely store the necessary authentication tokens to access your Gmail account on your behalf.</li>
              <li><strong>Custom System Prompt Data:</strong> We store the custom System Prompt and any rules or preferences you create to personalize how Orbee handles your email.</li>
              <li><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us directly (e.g., for support), we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address, phone number, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>b. Information Collected Through Your Use of the Service:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Gmail Data (Accessed on Your Behalf):</strong> When you use Orbee to interact with your Gmail:
                <ul>
                  <li>We access email headers (sender, recipient, subject, date).</li>
                  <li>We access email content (body text, and potentially attachment metadata if relevant to a feature you use) to provide summaries, draft replies, and apply your custom rules.</li>
                  <li>We execute actions on your emails (archive, delete, flag, send replies) based on your voice commands and System Prompt rules.</li>
                  <li><strong>Important:</strong> Orbee processes your email content to provide its features but does not permanently store the full body of your emails on its servers beyond what is necessary for the immediate processing of a command or a very short-term cache for session continuity. Summaries generated may be temporarily cached. We do not use your email content to train our general AI models, nor do we sell your email content.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Voice & Call Data (Processed by Vapi and OpenAI):</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>When you call your Orbee phone number, your voice commands are processed. This involves creating audio recordings and transcripts of your interactions. This data is processed by our voice AI partner (Vapi) and the underlying language model provider (OpenAI) to understand your requests and generate responses. Please refer to Vapi's and OpenAI's privacy policies for their data handling practices.</li>
                  <li>We receive transcripts and interaction metadata from Vapi to fulfill your requests and improve our Service.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Call Metadata:</strong> We collect metadata about your calls to Orbee, such as the <code>call.from</code> number (your Caller ID), the Orbee number dialed, call duration, and timestamps.</li>
              <li><strong>Usage Data & Analytics:</strong> We may collect information about how you access and use the Service, including actions taken within the web dashboard, feature usage frequency, and performance data. This helps us understand how our Service is used and identify areas for improvement. This may include IP addresses, browser type, device type, and operating system.</li>
              <li><strong>SMS Notification Data:</strong> If you opt-in for SMS notifications, we will use your registered phone number to send you alerts as configured.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="how-we-use-information">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

              <li><strong>To Improve Our Service:</strong> To understand usage patterns, troubleshoot issues, analyze performance, develop new features, and enhance the intelligence and usability of Orbee.</li>
              <li><strong>For Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> To protect the security of your account and our Service, detect and prevent fraudulent activity, and enforce our terms.</li>
              <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> To comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or governmental requests.</li>
            </ul>
